      <string id="org-freedesktop-ModemManager1-Contacts_help">The policy manages the restriction on the ability to add, modify and delete mobile broadband contacts

Disabled/Unconfigured - restrictions are defined by system parameters.

Enabled - restriction with defined rights;

Possible values:

"No" - set restriction with action denial (user is not allowed to perform the action);

"Yes" - remove the restriction (the user can perform the action without any authentication);

"Auth_self" - the user must enter his/her password for authentication. Note, this level of restriction is not sufficient for most multi-user applications, "Auth_admin" is usually recommended;

"Auth_admin" - the user must enter the administrator password at each request. Requires authentication of the user with administrator privileges;

"Auth_self_keep" - similar to "Auth_self", but authorization is maintained for a short period of time (e.g., five minutes). Note, this level of restriction is insufficient for most multi-user applications, "Auth_admin_keep" is generally recommended;

"Auth_admin_keep" - similar to "Auth_admin", but authorization is maintained for a short period of time (e.g., five minutes);
      
Note: the possession of administrative rights in a PolicyKit context is determined by its rules. By default, Alt asks for the password of a user in the "wheel" group.
