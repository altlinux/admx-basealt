This policy grants or restricts users the right to install packages through the PackageKit package management interface.

Disabled/Not configured — Permissions are determined by system settings. Default is «Auth_admin»

Enabled — permission to mount with set rights;

Possible values:

"No" — block permissions (the user is not allowed to perform the action);

"Yes" — grant permissions (the user can perform the action without any authentication);

"Auth_self" — The user must enter their password to authenticate. Note that this permission is not sufficient for most uses on multi-user systems, the "Auth_admin" permission is generally recommended;

"Auth_admin" — The user must enter an administrator password on each request. Requires user authentication with administrator rights;

"Auth_self_keep" — Similar to "Auth_self", but the authorization is kept for a short period of time (for example, five minutes). Note that this permission is not sufficient for most uses on multi-user systems, the "Auth_admin_keep" permission is generally recommended;

"Auth_admin_keep" — similar to "Auth_admin", but the authorization is kept for a short period of time (for example, five minutes);

Note: the possession of administrative rights in the context of PolicyKit is determined by its rules. By default, Alt asks for the password of the user in the "wheel" group.
